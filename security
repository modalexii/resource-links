    Deploying TLS the hard way
    Last weekend I finally deployed TLS for timtaubert.de and decided to write up what I learned on the way hoping that it would be useful for anyone doing the same. Instead of only giving you a few buzz words I want to provide background information on how TLS and certain HTTP extensions work and why you should use them or configure TLS in a certain way.
